# DTRAC
## A decentralized threshold revocable anonymous credential scheme (DTRAC) is proposed as a practical and privacy-aware authentication framework over blockchain, which provides decentralized issuance of credentials, allowing a threshold number of validators to be corrupt. DTRAC enables a single credential to be presented to a service provider in the multi-certifier model and allows anonymity revocation using the concept of threshold opening.
