# DTRAC - Decentralized Threshold Revocable Anonymous Credential Scheme

Welcome to the DTRAC repository, which is part of a semester project developed under the guidance of [Prof. Kotaro Kataoka](https://g.co/kgs/TqCYL6). DTRAC is a practical and privacy-aware authentication framework built on blockchain technology. It introduces the concept of a decentralized threshold revocable anonymous credential scheme, providing decentralized credential issuance and enabling a threshold number of validators to be corrupt without compromising security. DTRAC supports presenting a single credential to a service provider in a multi-certifier model and includes anonymity revocation using the concept of threshold opening.

## Introduction

DTRAC represents a significant advancement in privacy-aware authentication systems. It leverages blockchain technology to provide decentralized and secure credential issuance and verification, even in the presence of potentially corrupt validators. With DTRAC, users can enjoy the benefits of privacy, security, and flexibility in credential presentation.

## Project Details

DTRAC offers the following key features:

- **Decentralized Credential Issuance**: Credentials are issued in a decentralized manner, enhancing security and trust.

- **Threshold Revocation**: DTRAC allows for the revocation of credentials through a threshold mechanism, ensuring the privacy of users.

- **Anonymous Credential Presentation**: Users can present a single credential to service providers, preserving anonymity.

## Implementation

This repository includes an implementation of a real-world use case called "Privacy Preserving Loan Application" on the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as a practical demonstration of the DTRAC protocol on a testnet environment.

## Documentation

For in-depth information about the DTRAC protocol, please refer to the documentation provided in the [project report](#project-report) and the [research paper](#research-paper).
